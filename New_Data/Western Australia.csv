Your new role

An exciting opportunity exists for a Research Fellow to join the Curtin School of Allied Health working with the enAble Institute. The successful candidate will work with Associate Prof. Melanie Ferguson on the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funded project: Empowering adults with hearing loss by increasing informed choice, accessibility, and uptake of hearing healthcare.

International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research
Rare opportunity to lead internationally renowned, multi-disciplinary research centre for science, engineering and data intensive astronomy
Based in the stunning city of Perth, Western Australia
The International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) is an equal joint venture between Curtin University and The University of Western Australia with funding support from the State Government of Western Australia. ICRAR has research nodes at both universities and is host to over 200 staff and postgraduate students. Founded in 2009, ICRAR has produced over 2200 research papers attracting 77,000 citations, won over $100 million in external competitive grants and had its work featured in more than 18,000 international media articles.
ICRAR plays a vital role in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project—a global collaboration of 16 countries to build two of the world’s largest radio telescopes in Australia and South Africa. The Centre is contributing to infrastructure for the Australian site and is responsible for science data processing systems and array synchronisation technologies. As a partner of the SKA Observatory, ICRAR is contributing to the Observatory’s science programs and supporting the creation and operation of an Australian SKA Regional Centre.
ICRAR is also a key organisation for translating SKA developments and astronomy skills to industries including space situational awareness, space communications and broad applications of machine learning technologies.
As the Executive Director, your primary role will be one of research leadership and you will be expected to take a leading part in developing a strategy to ensure the Centre's innovative research portfolio continues to be driven by excellence, impact and engagement. This will involve influencing strategic decision-making processes of existing and prospective partners with interests in SKA related research, including the ICRAR Board, Ministers and Departments of the Federal and the WA State Government, CSIRO, Australian industry, your Executive Team and the wider ICRAR community of research and professional staff.
With an established international reputation in one or more areas of Astronomy Research, you will need to demonstrate motivation, excitement, and a strategic leadership capability. You bring experience and a track record of success in leading research organisations, developing and implementing strategic and business plans, and working with Boards. Your application will be supported with demonstrated abilities in research coordination across University, Government and Industry sectors; competencies in finance, contract management, human resources, industry engagement, communication and marketing; and relevant tertiary qualifications including a PhD.
