Our research focuses on the four key areas impacting children’s health: cancer, genomics and genetic diseases, neurobiology, and embryology. Our strong international reputation is based on decades of significant research outcomes in these areas of specialty.

Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a supercomputer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes tumour samples through a proteomic method, DIA-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of the goals of ProCan is to measure proteins in tens of thousands of cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive, personalized medicine.

Amazon Web Services (AWS)* is the leading provider of cloud computing services, providing IT infrastructure offerings such as on-demand compute capacity, storage, content delivery, database services and more. The AWS Public Policy team is at the forefront of helping customers in regulated industries (such as telecoms companies) maximize the benefits of cloud computing by removing regulatory and policy blockers to cloud adoption. It also supports and facilitates expansion of cloud infrastructure and services in APAC – which sometimes requires coordination with telecoms sector regulators.

AWS is looking for a talented, innovative, and well-connected individual to drive regional policy advocacy strategy and represent AWS before policymakers and regulators in the telecommunications industry. The successful candidate will be responsible for advocating for favorable policies and regulations to promote AWS’ business interests in the telecoms industry vertical and developing strategies to convince regulators of the security and innovation potential of the cloud. They will also support AWS infrastructure and service expansion in APAC.

This Singapore-based position (other locations in APAC can be considered) reports to the AWS Head of Public Policy for Regulated Industries, APAC, and includes the following responsibilities:
Familiarize oneself with all aspects of the AWS telecoms sector business in APAC and build up comprehensive knowledge of AWS services and use cases;

Facilitate high-level meetings between AWS executives and key stakeholders, including senior government officials, regulators, industry associations and partners to promote and advocate the company’s policy priorities.
The successful candidate must be inquisitive, enthusiastic about technology, enjoy being continually challenged, and demonstrate sound judgment in ambiguous situations. They should have public policy experience in a regulated industry, preferably from telecommunications, but experience from the financial services, healthcare, or utilities industries are also relevant. This candidate must be able to point to successful advocacy outcomes in one of these industries.
