AE Capital is focused on forecasting the future. Our approach is scientific and combines the power of human expertise with machine learning to create algorithms that predict the world’s financial markets. As with complex problems like weather forecasting, the best forecasts come from humans interacting with the computer models and we have been developing a similar philosophy in finance for over 10 years.

AE Capital is one of the few businesses in the world to have successfully used machine learning in finance, and our commitment to continuous improvement in all that we do has led to another recent breakthrough. We have developed a framework that allows traditional “discretionary” traders to create algorithmic trading models, without the need for programming experience. Secondly, we have created specialised data sets that allow machine learning experts to apply their trade without the need for deep financial expertise.

We now need talented individuals who can bring their expertise and domain knowledge - whether it be in financial markets, data science, computer science, software engineering or infrastructure - and apply their skills to our new methodology as we grow.

We are always on the lookout for self-motivated, results-driven analytical minds who enjoy problem solving and can bring their skills and experience to our team. This is a unique opportunity to learn from industry leaders in our collaborative and hands-on environment, pushing the boundaries of finance and technology.

Enjoy the many benefits of working for AE Capital, at our offices in Melbourne, one of the world’s most liveable cities. With flexible work hours, genuine autonomy, and the ability to have a direct impact on the business, our unique culture embodies the Aussie spirit of mateship, teamwork, and the open exchange of ideas in a fun, dynamic and informal environment.
What we look for
Nearly everything we do at AE Capital is unique and different which results in our world leading outcomes. The continued success of this requires teamwork, strong problem-solving skills, great communication and lots of (dead-end) experimentation.

So, when ploughing through these tough problems, we want to work with likeminded people who
are passionate and excited about what they do
are loyal and honest to each other
are hard working
have a thirst for knowledge and try to solve one’s own problems
focus on the detail and correctness of their work
and are dedicated to get the job done
because this, above all else, will determine our continued, mutual success.
The job

As a Quantitative Analyst you will use your expertise in computer modelling to work with our traders and contribute to the design and development of our predictive models, that our quantitative developers and software engineers then bring to life.

We are a “Bayesian” firm that values intuitive priors and empirical inference to identify and prove a theory or relationship. We are not afraid to explore new ideas and being ""applied academics” at the core, we will encourage theoretical and practical pursuits in data science, machine learning, stochastic processes, optimization, signal processing and control systems, to name a few. Financial markets are truly the most humbling of all predictive systems and the optimal place to test and hone your skills.

We are a small and agile company that will provide you with the ability to engage and work across all areas of the business and collaborate with all your colleagues to collectively design and build solutions that result in measurable, positive outcomes.

About You:

You will need to be articulate, intelligent, naturally inquisitive, and thrive in environments that encourage new ideas and value thought leadership.

You will need to be able to demonstrate:
A strong academic foundation with a passion for truth and the scientific method
A high-level of initiative and self-motivation.
Excellent coding skills and deep experience with big data sets (Matlab, Python, C, Fortran, or similar).
Ideally you will be comfortable in a Unix environment with knowledge of cluster computing.
A willingness to further develop and specialize your skills including the knowledge of financial markets if you are new to the industry.
Your background
Masters or PhD in Physics, Atmospheric Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or an equivalent discipline
Exposure to financial markets and software development will be advantageous but not essential for the right person.

We are happy to consider entry level and experienced applicants. If you are accountable, professional, enjoy a collaborative high achieving team environment and want to work with some of the brightest and best in the business, all you need to do is send us your CV and Cover letter. We’ll invite you to undertake a few quick online assessments and then be in touch.

In return we will provide you with a work environment and opportunity that will enable you to thrive, be heard and be valued; plus be very well compensated.
