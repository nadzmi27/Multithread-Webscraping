promoting the companies service offering
advising and supporting growers through crop protection and nutrition plans
constructing informative reports and recommendations
offering technical guidance and assistance direct to growers
liaising with key industry stakeholders to stay up to date with new technologies
collecting, analysing and interpreting data
supporting, maintaining and improving current client relationships
progressing and developing the reach of the business
What kind of person will fit the role?
It is vital that you have tertiary qualifications in agricultural science and/or agronomy.
