What makes us different
Our senior team has a track record of successful exits in the Analytics space. Our expertise, network, and culture are driving our start-up forward into this phase of growth. Our co-founder sold his previous analytics firm to Deloitte and counted some of the largest multinationals amongst his clients. To innovate we must have the diversity of thought. And that requires diversity of experience, skills, and thinking. Our team includes data engineers, data scientists, computer scientists, commercial finance and actuarial analysts. Our team blends commercial and technology skillsets. We aren’t clever techies guessing at cool problems to solve, we are solving the toughest problems we encountered in our commercial roles. We are rapidly gaining traction within our niche, the $3.0T superannuation industry. Our customers are amazing advocates for our work. We are lean and agile; no committees or bureaucracy to get in the way of rapidly innovating and differentiating our solutions to market incumbents. We embrace creativity not stifle it. As a result, we are outcompeting large multinationals with products and services that are 10x better. We work smarter, not harder. We get stuff done. We work as a team. We are learning each day. We are certainly not perfect but we aim for perfection each day. You will be taking responsibility for delivering new features to Luci from definition to done, and better. You are super smart, adaptable, understand how the analytics technology landscape is changing, and have always wanted to work in a culture that provides the freedom to innovate with cutting-edge technology and apply this to our superfund data & analytics platform.
What we are building

CSIRO acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the land, sea and waters, of the area that we live and work on across Australia. We acknowledge their continuing connection to their culture and pay our respects to their Elders past and present. View our vision towards reconciliation

The Opportunity
Enhance your PhD studies and kickstart your research career with a CSIRO AI for Missions PhD scholarship
Work alongside leading data scientists and engineers in real life projects aimed at solving Australia’s biggest challenges.
Our scholarship students are the next generation research leaders in data science who progress to a diverse range of careers in industry, research and academia

CSIRO has invested $25M over four years in the AI for Missions Program to create novel AI research and technologies that will enable Missions to solve Australia’s greatest challenges. To deliver on this goal we will partner with universities and industry to advance the science, technology and impact of AI to support Missions.


We are inviting applications for the AI for Missions PhD scholarship program for the project ‘Identification of environmental risk factors for antimicrobial resistance using spatio-temporal statistical models.’ We are looking for diverse and creative scholars, who can demonstrate academic and research excellence, and are capable of driving our impactful research projects that help shape Australia’s digital future. Students will have the opportunity to be part of a cohort and participate in the coursework program offered by the Next Generation Graduates Programs. Our previous scholarship recipients are successfully employed in the industry, technology companies and SMEs, universities, and leading research institutes in Australia and around the globe. Our graduates complete the program with a lifelong connection to CSIRO through our alumni network.
For this project, experience in the application of Bayesian spatio-temporal statistical models (ideally) in an environmental domain and a first class honours degree in statistics or data analytics will be highly regarded.
Project Description:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global threat. The least-well understood component of the one-health perspective to AMR is the role that the environmental component plays in eventual clinical presentations of AMR. This project proposes a statistical approach that will be applied to a specific freshwater case, but in a way that can be readily generalised to other marine or freshwater applications or case studies. In particular, the project will identify generalisable (surrogate) AMR markers and use them as response variable(s) in a spatio-temporal model that can identify the effect of environmental covariates using observations with point (such as water quality) or areal (such as land use) characteristics.
Project Supervisors:
Keith Hayes, CSIRO, keith.hayes@csiro.au
Erica Donner, University of South Australia, erica.donner@unisa.edu.au


Location: Adelaide or Hobart - the students are expected to spend more than 50% of their time based in CSIRO.

Access to world-class research facilities and excellent tools, support and resources to bring your research to life.
Join the Next Generation Graduate Program cohort that includes support and course works.
Connect into an inclusive culture where the diversity of people, experiences and views are valued, and where you will use your skills to help solve complex national and global problems.

Candidates:
Need to contact the University supervisor and the CSIRO supervisor to secure their PhD enrolment in the corresponding University.
Will be required to obtain and provide a National Police Check or equivalent.
