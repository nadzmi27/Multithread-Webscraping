PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.

As a Senior Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team:The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting new approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.

Who You Are
Senior Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Senior Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Senior Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a Senior Product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.
5+ years of product management experience focused on personalisation systems and platforms on the cloud, preferably on AWS.
1+ years experience in managing or mentoring 2+ junior product managers.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.
Ability to drive, contribute to, and communicate solutions to technical product challenges.
Ability to roll-up your sleeves and work in process or resource gaps and fill it in yourself

AWS certification desirable

As a Technical Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team: The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting alternative approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.

Who You Are
Technical Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Technical Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Technical Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a technical product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.

Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.

GREENPEACE
Greenpeace is a world-leading independent campaigning organisation using peaceful, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems and develop solutions for a green and peaceful future. Our priority focus in the Australia Pacific region is tackling climate change.
THE TEAM
We are at a unique turning point in the race to stop catastrophic climate change. So that together we can have maximum impact in the world, our team is on a mission to create a modern, agile, digitally savvy culture equipped to drive towards a green and peaceful future.
Our team is a key part of the Fundraising and Technology department. We ensure all our platforms work together seamlessly, allowing our colleagues across Australia and the Pacific to get the most out of our tools.
THE ROLE
In this role you will report directly to the Engineering Lead, and will have the opportunity to:
Do daily administration and support for our Salesforce CRM such as user management, configuration, upgrades, documentation, training and reporting
Complete regular data processes including debiting of supporters, outcome processing for Telefundraising programs, finance reconciliation tasks, data imports and exports, standard system flow checks, backup checks.
Champion good data hygiene and practices within the organisation
Provide support, training or workshops as needed for our HubSpot and Salesforce Users.
THE IDEAL CANDIDATE
We know you’re in high demand. You could work for an implementation partner, in-house at a corporate, or even at Salesforce. But while you do that, Australia is set to build the largest gas mine ever and continue burning dirty coal at an alarming rate… all whilst climate change rapidly escalates.
So come work with us instead! We don’t have an in-house chef, but, unlike the agency world, at Greenpeace you are not bound by billable hours and targets, and you don’t have to act as sales for the product. With us, you can use your knowledge and skills to directly impact the team and the millions of supporters and crew that hold Greenpeace dear to their heart!
As well as having a passion for Greenpeace’s campaign work, you’re ideal for this role if you have a strong knowledge of the Salesforce CRM, data management practices and knowledge of SQL or SQL-like languages. You will also have:
A tertiary qualification in a technical field (information technology, computer science, engineering, business analytics, statistics) or a relevant discipline preferred;
At least two years of experience working as a Salesforce Administrator – NPSP experience preferred; and
A drive to improve our data quality and make Greenpeace’s work more efficient and impactful.
For more information read the Job Description on our website.
WHAT WE CAN OFFER YOU
A rare opportunity to take action on one of the most important issues of the moment – climate;
The independence and scope to experiment, innovate and advance the aims of the team;
A genuine approach to wellbeing, including flexible working arrangements and an integrity framework;
An organisation filled with talented, warm, and caring team members, so that you can bring your whole self to work;
A fast-paced, high impact culture of accountability that genuinely celebrates inclusivity and diversity; and
An organisation that really values the digital space and management that has a technical background (and has your back).
Annual Salary $88,170.76 + superannuation.
We welcome applicants Australia wide, with a preference for Sydney or Melbourne for the opportunity to join in-person staff workshops, meetings, get-togethers and creative confrontation activities.
HOW TO APPLY
Research shows that candidates from underrepresented groups (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, People of Colour, women, non-binary and gender diverse people, LGBTQIA+ communities, and people living with a disability) often don’t apply for roles if they don’t meet all the criteria – unlike majority candidates meeting significantly fewer requirements. We strongly encourage you to apply if you’re interested; we’d love to know how you can amplify our team with your unique experience!
To apply for this role please submit a CV (of no more than 3 pages) and a separate Cover Letter (of no more than 1 page) detailing your suitability for the role.
Note: Not all responsibilities and competencies listed in the Job Description need to be addressed; it is left to the discretion of the applicant which to focus on.

Technology has revolutionised the business space and is now more powerful than ever. But with great power comes great responsibility. That’s why we’re here. Part risk, part tech, we help clients protect their intellectual property and data!

Who are we?
Call us biased, but we’re probably the people with the coolest jobs at Deloitte. We help clients navigate tech risks through internal investigations and forensically analysing electronic evidence collected from phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems. Then, we design solutions that help our clients risk-align and future-proof their systems. Pretty cool, right?

What will your typical day look like?
We’ll be honest, it’s hard to tell you what an average day will look like at Deloitte because every day is just so different! Working on projects with an impressive portfolio of top-tier clients, you’ll get enviable experience as you:

Get exposure to tracing data breaches, intellectual property theft, misuse of computer systems and fraudulent activity (such as corruption and money laundering)
Roll up your sleeves to investigate electronic evidence collected from mobile phones, computers, networks, storage devices and backup systems
Design solutions for engagements relating to electronic discovery, forensic investigations, legal support and digital forensics
Explore and identify patterns in data to underpin decisions and outcomes for clients
Track evidence and prepare detailed reports on forensic analysis findings

Enough about us, let’s talk about you.
We know that as a student, you may not necessarily have a ton of work experience, and that’s okay! At Deloitte, we value your potential to grow more than anything else.

You’re someone who:
Is studying a degree in Computer Science, IT, Software Engineering, Digital Forensics, Data Science or InfoSys
Is comfortable with turning ambiguous problems and open-ended tasks into creative solutions
Is passionate about investigating data to uncover hidden insights
Has a keen eye for detail and possesses strong communication and writing skills
Works best collaboratively – you thrive when working in a team!
Demonstrates a high level of integrity and maintains confidentiality at all times (this is integral considering the nature of work we do!)

Why Deloitte?
At Deloitte, we create positively differentiated work experiences that enable our people to feel valued and achieve their full potential. Deloitte Australia opens the door to a career that can cross borders virtually and physically across Asia Pacific to gain experience and access projects beyond Australia’s borders. We value difference, and embrace people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, gender identities, abilities and thinking styles.

As a Senior Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team:The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting new approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.

Who You Are
Senior Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Senior Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Senior Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a Senior Product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.

1+ years experience in managing or mentoring 2+ junior product managers.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.

As a Senior Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team:The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting new approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.

Who You Are
Senior Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a Senior Product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.

1+ years experience in managing or mentoring 2+ junior product managers.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.

As a Technical Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team: The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting alternative approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.

Who You Are
Technical Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Technical Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Technical Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a technical product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.
3+ years of product management experience focused on personalisation systems and platforms on the cloud, preferably on AWS.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.
Post-graduate qualifications in data science or similar (statistics, computer science)
Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:

An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.

Do you enjoy watching how company specific news and current events impact the financial markets? Like solving puzzles and working competitively with a team to win?

SIG is looking for final year students who are interested in why financial markets move the way they do to join our 2023 Buy Side Research Graduate Program.

SIG is one of the world's largest market makers, with a unique approach to trading, technology, and research. While this background puts us at the top of our game, what really makes us successful is our quantitative approach to decision making and the collaboration between our employees.

SIG Buy Side Research Graduate Program
Our Buy Side Research Analysts work directly with our traders to identify trading opportunities in the equity and options markets. From providing real-time opinions on breaking news to in-depth analysis of future catalyst events, our Buy Side Research Analysts have a constant impact on our trading strategies.

As a Buy Side Research Analyst, you will be responsible for finding opportunities that other market participants may not be capitalizing on, either by discovering new information or considering existing knowledge from a different perspective. You will be embedded in a sector-focused trading desk and work collaboratively with traders who rely heavily on the analysis you provide to make trading decisions. Grads can expect:
Option theory and option modelling lessons in the classroom.
Decision making - using game theory, decision science, poker, and other strategy games. It's true what you've heard!
Real impact - SIG Grads work closely with our experienced traders and researchers on real-world projects that directly impact our trading business.
What we're looking for
Problem Solvers: You enjoy solving puzzles and love it when you discover a solution to a difficult problem, with a demonstrated interest in strategic games and/or competitive activities.
Analytical + Logical: When it comes to decision making, you use clear and sound reasoning. You're rational and like to use analytical data and financial research skills to come up with sensible solutions.
Communicators: You enjoy building relationships with those you work closely with. You enjoy sharing ideas, expressing your thoughts, and listening to the views of others - excellent verbal and written communication skills are a must for this role!
Curious: You're excited by a career in the financial markets and the reasons why markets move in the way they do.
Soon-to-be or Recent Graduate: Confirmed plan to graduate by December 2022 with a degree in Finance, Economics or related discipline, distinction average WAM, from an Australian or New Zealand University.

As a Technical Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team: The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting alternative approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.
As Technical Product Manager in this role, you will

Do in-depth data and A/B-test experiment analysis using in-house / cloud-based analytics tools
Define requirements, set OKRs, measure KPIs, and track test experiments
Who You Are
Technical Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Technical Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Technical Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a technical product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.
3+ years of product management experience focused on personalisation systems and platforms on the cloud, preferably on AWS.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.

As a Technical Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team: The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting alternative approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.
As Technical Product Manager in this role, you will
Responsibilities:
Lead one of the subteam within the Core Matching team that enables the world class machine learning models at Indeed, collaborating with product managers and data scientists from across Indeed.
Lead the team to achieve the mission of providing relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed
Lead the transformation of our systems into a platform that can be used by any team at Indeed.
Collaborate to architect a scalable and robust end-end machine learning platform, incorporating latest industry best practices and feedback from customers inside of Indeed.

Find new opportunities with engineers to develop tools and systems to improve Indeed’s recommendations models
Partner with engineering teams responsible for developing personalization systems and core components of Indeed’s infrastructure in Tokyo, Austin, and other Indeed offices
Do in-depth data and A/B-test experiment analysis using in-house / cloud-based analytics tools
Define requirements, set OKRs, measure KPIs, and track test experiments
Who You Are
Technical Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Technical Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Technical Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a technical product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.
3+ years of product management experience focused on personalisation systems and platforms on the cloud, preferably on AWS.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.
Ability to drive, contribute to, and communicate solutions to technical product challenges.
Ability to roll-up your sleeves and work in process or resource gaps and fill it in yourself
Excellent written and oral communication skills in English
Expected business trip to Austin as needed.
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Electrical Engineering or a closely related field, or equivalent experience is desirable
AWS certification desirable

As a Technical Product Manager at Indeed, you will be part of our Core Matching team.
The team’s mission is to achieve the best in the world recommendation-based experience for all job-seekers and jobs. To this end, the team runs a large-scale recommendation system that leverages data from many places at Indeed, where we transform data into recommendations, and distribute them across multiple Indeed products. To achieve that, the team works closely with related groups in Tokyo, Austin, Seattle and Singapore.

The Core Matching team has 4 subteams and will grow in 6 subteams;

Matching Science Team: To provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging both content and behavioral signals, from all Indeed’s surfaces, delivering the most accurate ranking and scoring that lead to high volumes of job applications, and high rates of hires. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team aims to rank and score jobs, and the other rank and score candidates.
Matching Discovery Team: The team goal is to provide the best recommendation coverage and relevancy by leveraging large scale, high quality data to find and retrieve the right candidates and the right jobs fast. It includes two teams within this group, with one Technical Product Manager each. One team focuses on job retrieval, and the other on candidates retrieval.
Data Integration Team: This team builds the data pipelines, ensures data freshness, quality and integrity that enable our machine learning models to perform.
ML Integration, this team has 3 subteams: one is focused on current model’s support, such as features to enable usage of Linear Regression and DNN models. The second team focuses on supporting alternative approaches, such as XGBoost and TensorFlow, and the third team owns the most sophisticated Machine Learning architecture at Indeed, and now is in the process of scaling and making it available to other internal teams.


You will be empowered to set ambitious goals for your product and team. Your goals will not be easy to achieve; they should inspire and motivate the team to think big.

You’re capable of setting and articulating a clear vision for your portfolio, engaging and influencing stakeholders at all levels and across multiple teams in order to achieve goals. You use strategic thinking to help you to negotiate, align and deliver your product vision, while ensuring shared goals and positive impact to the whole of Indeed.

You also will work closely with the development team on a daily basis, sitting next to developers, defining requirements and analyzing tests with their input. You will do data analysis yourself, whether it’s doing queries in MySQL, searching through logs, or using the plethora of in-house tools for analyzing data in order to gather evidence for strategic decisions. You will constantly create hypotheses for improving your product, test them, and learn from the results.

Our product development philosophy is similar to the Lean Startup philosophy. You will create MVPs, prototypes, simple tests to validate ideas and iterate.

We would prefer to spend time simplifying a feature to get it out the door this week than building flashy powerpoint decks for all hands meetings.
You will own the mission of the team to provide relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed, and execute against that vision to drive impactful product improvements. You are passionate about systems and engines that enable high quality machine learning, and delivering impact for all user products across Indeed. Data drives your decision making, and you influence others to do the same. You will work together with a team of data infrastructure and machine learning software engineers to realize ambitious goals. You will inspire and motivate the team to think big, while charting a path to deliver value at each step. You thrive at collaborating with partner teams across Indeed to find new opportunities and to solve tough problems together. You practice perpetual learning and love sharing and absorbing knowledge.
As Technical Product Manager in this role, you will
Responsibilities:
Lead one of the subteam within the Core Matching team that enables the world class machine learning models at Indeed, collaborating with product managers and data scientists from across Indeed.
Lead the team to achieve the mission of providing relevant recommendations to every job seeker and employer at Indeed
Lead the transformation of our systems into a platform that can be used by any team at Indeed.
Collaborate to architect a scalable and robust end-end machine learning platform, incorporating latest industry best practices and feedback from customers inside of Indeed.

Define requirements, set OKRs, measure KPIs, and track test experiments
Who You Are
Technical Product Managers at Indeed are analytical, creative, and collaborative. We obsess over data and drive for simplicity. You will guide the team by exemplifying these core values.

Technical Product Managers have the responsibility to deliver results, but no direct authority over peers in Engineering and Design. A successful Technical Product Manager leads by developing the trust and respect of teammates so you will have to influence others to follow your vision.

You, and your peers will be custodians of the Indeed culture of data and collaboration.

You will enjoy a casual work environment, flexible hours, and great compensation and benefits. There is a complete lack of office politics; if that is your specialty, look elsewhere.
You will wear many hats and constantly learn new things on the job. You will be surrounded by smart, dedicated, nice people. You will be proud of the company’s mission and your products' impact.
You will work directly with teams in Tokyo and Singapore as a technical product manager on a daily basis and coordinate closely with the counter partner teams in Austin. You will report to a manager in Australia.
3+ years of product management experience focused on personalisation systems and platforms on the cloud, preferably on AWS.
Outstanding data analysis and data-driven decision making skills, including A/B testing experience
Willingness to learn subject knowledge as you go further in order to lead a world-class data science and engineering team.
Ability to work effectively across technical, product, and business stakeholders. Prior experience developing a vision for your team that is aligned with business goals and defining effective OKRs for your product to measure progress toward that vision.
Prior experience leading a team using agile methodologies
Ability to work effectively with remote teams, comfortable managing communications across multiple channels (email, Slack, Zoom, etc) and continents to get people aligned and get things done.
Ability to drive, contribute to, and communicate solutions to technical product challenges.
Ability to roll-up your sleeves and work in process or resource gaps and fill it in yourself
Excellent written and oral communication skills in English
Expected business trip to Austin as needed.
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Electrical Engineering or a closely related field, or equivalent experience is desirable
AWS certification desirable

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.

Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:
The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its ‘scale up’ phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.

Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe. We’ve won coveted ‘Marketing Technology Company of the Year’ awards from both B&T and Mumbrella and featured twice as a Rising Star in the Deloitte Fast 50 Technology Awards.
The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.
Post-graduate qualifications in data science or similar (statistics, computer science)
Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:
The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its ‘scale up’ phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.

It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe. We’ve won coveted ‘Marketing Technology Company of the Year’ awards from both B&T and Mumbrella and featured twice as a Rising Star in the Deloitte Fast 50 Technology Awards.
The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.
Post-graduate qualifications in data science or similar (statistics, computer science)
Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:
The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its ‘scale up’ phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.
Career progression galore. The company is growing at a crazy rate and you will be too!

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe. We’ve won coveted ‘Marketing Technology Company of the Year’ awards from both B&T and Mumbrella and featured twice as a Rising Star in the Deloitte Fast 50 Technology Awards.
The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.
Longer term opportunities in NLP, CV, Optimisation or Experimentation
Who you are:
You have 5+ years experience in a data science development role.
Post-graduate qualifications in data science or similar (statistics, computer science)
Strong programming skills with knowledge of Python, SQL and Unix
Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:
The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its ‘scale up’ phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.
Career progression galore. The company is growing at a crazy rate and you will be too!

PLAYGROUND XYZ is an advertising technology business headquartered in Sydney with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, London, Los Angeles and New York.
Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.
We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe.

The opportunity:
To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for a superstar data science professional to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist.
The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
Analyzing eye tracking data to curate training sets
Developing a framework to test web page similarity metrics
Running experiments to test the impact of NLP based metrics on attention time.
Contributing to research whitepapers.

Experience with a Cloud Vendor Stack (preferably GCP)
You put a focus on building reusable code components for repeatable data science.
Open and collaborative nature, ability to discuss your experiments and work through problems.
The perks:

It’s the award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy, stand out from the pack, and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.
In this role you’ll be developing tools and experiments to improve our machine learning models and understand the role of page context in Ad attention. Key skills include: understanding of what drives machine learning models and how to improve them, experience doing large scale aggregation based feature engineering, and an understanding of experimental design and hypothesis testing.
What you’ll be doing:
Developing features and models for new rich media ad formats
