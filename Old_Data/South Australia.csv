Remote Employee: An employee who works in a remote location for the entirety of the normally scheduled work week, for a period of more than 90 days in a rolling 12 month period. These employees do not need to live near an Amazon office, but must live in Australia.

ABOUT US
Amazon has built a reputation for excellence with a mission to be the earth’s most customer-centric company, a company that customers from all over the globe will recognise, value, and trust for both our products and our service. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is carrying on that tradition while leading the world in cloud technologies.

The Escalation and Event Management (E2M) team is part of the broader AWS Support organisation and is dedicated to managing critical escalations, customer facing communications, and handling large-scale customer impacting events. E2M’s purpose is to drive operational excellence and improvements to the overall customer experience.

ABOUT YOU
E2M is looking for people who are detailed, analytical thinkers as well as creative problem solvers, with a strong bias for action. You are someone who is not constrained by the notion of “how things are usually done”, and you are equally comfortable operating in the minute detail, as well as with coordinating efforts at the forty thousand foot view. You confidently act as an advocate of your customer, maintaining composure in dynamic and high pressure situations. You are comfortable working on highly technical initiatives to consistently improve the AWS customer experience. You are someone who excels at working in a dynamic environment while collaborating with some of the smartest people in the industry, and you get excited about owning critical infrastructure services that serve global customers, every second of the day!
Finally, you are passionate about technology with a desire to learn more and do more with AWS.

ABOUT THE ROLE
As members of the AWS Support E2M Event Management team, we work to identify widespread and systemic customer facing problems for Amazon Web Services. We are responsible for monitoring internal tools to identify customers impacting issues. When a problem is identified, we ensure the appropriate stakeholders are engaged to drive the resolution of the problem and act as an advocate of the customer to both report on and manage the customer experience. Because of our unique role as Escalation Engineers, we have front-and-center limitless exposure to all things AWS, including numerous leading edge technologies.

Every day will bring new and exciting challenges that include elements of:
Provide critical incident response/management (including leading calls with internal/external participants) for customer’s critical workloads and AWS Service Teams
Provide crisp and timely communication on developing issues to relevant internal and external customers
Drive down mean time to engagement and communication for all incident types
Facilitate Post-Mortem/Root Cause Analysis after each event to mitigate problem recurrence
Work with key stakeholders across AWS to improve the customer experience and develop mechanisms that support operational excellence
Analyse data trends on internal tickets, customer contacts, social media, and network monitors to identify potential issues
Build a broad understanding of AWS architecture and service inter-dependencies
Design, build, or collaborate on solutions using automation and self-repair rather than relying on human intervention
Other duties as required by the organisation

We are looking to recruit a MinEx CRC Researcher in Mineral Systems Geoscience to work with the School of Physical Sciences on a three year fixed term appointment commencing immediately.
This is a great opportunity to undertake research on minerals systems with The University of Adelaide and the Geological Survey of South Australia (GSSA) within the National Drilling Initiative in the MinEx Cooperative Research Centre (MinEx CRC).
The successful applicant will play a pivotal role in The University of Adelaide and Geological Survey of South Australia’s mineral exploration research program.
Project context:
The GSSA is currently undertaking a program of geoscientific analysis in the western Gawler Craton as part of the Gawler Phase 2 project. Datasets that will be collected at the regional scale include gravity and magnetotelluric geophysical data together with a program of whole rock geochemical and geochronological characterisation of publicly available drill cores stored in the South Australian Drill Core Reference Library. This project has as its focus the region of the Gawler Craton that will be the location of GSSA’s second National Drilling Initiative (NDI) project within MinEx CRC. The combined efforts of the Gawler Phase 2 and MinEx CRC research in this region has the potential to provide breakthrough insights into mineral systems in the region and support new mineral discovery.
In particular, the new geochemical, geochronological, isotopic, mineralogical and petrophysical data on samples from over 4500m of existing drill core samples are aimed at testing stratigraphic models for known mineralisation and characterising magmatic events.
To compliment this rock characterisation, this MinEx CRC researcher position will be tasked with developing new proxies for mineralisation-related fluid flow in metamorphic rocks. This project will focus on developing methods for identifying and measuring fertility in drill materials and thereby map regional fluid conduits which may provide broad controls on Au mineralisation. These new proxies can be applied to drill materials acquired during the MinEx CRC Gawler NDI and by explorers across the region and potentially in other metamorphic terranes.
The successful candidate will work collaboratively with other UoA and MinEx CRC researchers, will develop a research program focussed in the western Gawler Craton that will aim to:
characterise fluids involved in Au mineralisation of the western Gawler Craton and
enable the mapping of fluid movement at tenement- to deposit-scale, and thereby provide a mechanism of identifying more prospective regions of the western Gawler Craton.
The project will focus on accessory mineral phases in granulite to amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks. Accessory phases such as monazite, apatite and xenotime are sensitive to changes in pressure, temperature, and fluid composition in the metamorphic environment. The aim of the petrological, chemical, and isotopic investigations of these samples will be to date them and to identify if there are signals of early or pre-metamorphic fluid flow events that may have been responsible for gold mineralisation. Mineral phases to be targeted may include monazite, zircon, pyrite, apatite, allanite and xenotime. Samples will be derived from drill core in mineralised, weakly mineralised and ‘background’ rocks in the western Gawler Craton.
The successful candidate will be able to use both in-situ (laser-ablation) and solution based dating approaches (established and/or to be developed), using our newly refurbished LA-ICP MS/MS and TIMS/ATONA systems.
Complementary to studies of accessory phases, the project will also investigate at the regional scale:
whole rock and vein quartz oxygen isotope compositions to look for signals of fluid flow preserved through granulite/amphibolite facies metamorphism,
sulphur isotopic composition and trace element compositional mapping of pyrite associated with gold mineralisation in order to better define fluid sources for mineralisation.
The outcomes of this project will guide sampling and analysis during the Gawler NDI and provide explorers with methods of recognising a mineralising system in the region.
The successful candidate will need:
Research capability in the broad area of mineral system geology, with demonstrated ability in at least three of the following areas:
a comprehensive understanding of metamorphic processes
an understanding of the use of stable and radiogenic isotopes to identify fluid-rock interaction in metamorphosed crust
an understanding of the geochemical expressions of alteration systems and their metamorphosed equivalents
an understanding of igneous geochemistry and its implications for tectonic setting
a demonstrated understanding of geochronological methods that provide age constraints in high-temperature poly tectonic terrains.
To be successful you will need:
To demonstrate the ability to conduct independent research and critically analyse data, in addition to working effectively as a member of a research team.
A proven track record of publication of research results.
Experience in manipulating data using data analytical techniques would be advantageous.
Ability to liaise and communicate effectively with professional and industry bodies, government and members of the community with excellent verbal and written communication skills .
Have obtained a PhD or equivalent in an area of Earth Sciences.

MaxMine is an automated business improvement product which performs advanced analytics and data science on truck operational data to deliver significant cost savings and productivity gains to global miners. We apply engineering science and mathematics to operational data that we collect with our hardware.

There's never been a more exciting time to join Amazon Australia!

Who are we and what do we do?
We are a world class ML team based in Adelaide and created in April 2020 with the hire of the Director of Applied Science, Anton van den Hengel.

The Amazon ML AU team is developing state-of-the-art large-scale Machine Learning methods and applications involving terabytes of data. We work on applying machine learning, and particularly computer vision, to a wide spectrum of areas such as Amazon Retail, Seller Services, and Online Video. We also publish our research in the best venues internationally.

The team is high performing, learning-oriented, motivated to over-achieve, have fun, and make history. We also have access to great data, and the best computing infrastructure.

About Anton van den Hengel

Anton was the founding Director of The Australian Institute for Machine Learning (Australia’s largest machine learning research group), and is currently the Director of the Centre for Augmented Reasoning and a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide.

With over 18,000 citations and an H-index of 67, Anton is one of the worlds’ leading authorities on Computer Vision and ML.

About the Team
The vast majority of the team have PhDs in machine learning (ML) or a related area from some of the best institutions globally, including Oxford, Stanford, Edinburgh, and Imperial College London, and have published in the best places in the field including Science, NeurIPS, IEEE PAMI, and CVPR.

The team includes two world-class Principal Scientists and an Amazon Scholar. We value diversity and collaboration to help each other succeed as a team.

Where are we based?
Although the team is mainly Adelaide based, we support flexible working options blending at home and in office from our offices in
Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra or Brisbane.

Who are we looking for?
We are seeking to add talented and experienced Machine Learning Applied Scientists to our already awesome team.
We are a diverse team – our team members bring many different experiences to our mission and many different types of leaders succeed here, but have a few things in common:

High level of motivation with a drive to deliver results
Analytical acumen and a passion for solving problems (many of which are complex)
Ability to make decisions in the face of ambiguity
A desire to experiment, innovate and learn from both successes and failures
Excellent communication skills: ability to work independently across all levels of the organization, both locally and globally
Enjoyment for working as a team with a strong sense of ownership and personal achievement

What will I be working on?
It’s fair to say that no two days are alike – so this position suits someone who enjoys variety and problem-solving:
Use machine learning, computer vision, data mining and statistical techniques to create new, scalable solutions for business problems
Analyze and extract relevant information from large amounts of Amazon’s historical business data to help automate and optimize key processes
Design, develop and evaluate highly innovative models for predictive learning
Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation and model implementation
Research, implement and publish novel machine learning and statistical approaches

Additional Information
We have a number of current employees who split their time between lecturing at University and working for Amazon. Please let us know if this is of interest to you.

We provide full visa sponsorship which is a relatively fast process as we have been successful in obtaining Distinguished Talent visas for this team (typically takes weeks rather than months).

Full domestic and international relocation is also provided.

About Amazon Australia
Amazon offers great benefits including a competitive compensation and stock plan. We also look after our people with benefits including: subsidized private health and life insurance, commuter benefits and even an Amazon discount. Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.

We are certainly not perfect but we aim for perfection each day. You will be taking responsibility for delivering new features to Luci from definition to done, and better.

You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Fixed term, full-time position for 2 years with possibility of extension.
This is a unique opportunity to join one of Australia’s most well-funded applied physics research groups with outstanding connections to end-users. If you have a passion to see your efforts translated into real-world solutions then this is the position for you.
The position will be appointed into one of Australia’s best funded research groups that is working at the leading edge of precision experimental physics. You will work closely with a growing team at the new facility for Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) - one of only four such facilities worldwide – in collaboration with the CSIRO Environmental Tracer Laboratory (ETL) at Waite Campus. The project will be undertaken in the positive, supportive and ambitious environment that exists within the Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing (IPAS) at The University of Adelaide.
IPAS has an annual research budget of more than $15M p.a., a membership of more than 250 people, and is headquartered in a $100M bespoke research building on the CBD campus of The University of Adelaide. IPAS has available a superb range of optical diagnostic and manufacturing equipment, precision manufacturing (3D metal and plastics printing), glass and optical fibre manufacture and MBE semiconductor manufacturing. Equally important, IPAS provides strategic grants support, business development support and facility management through a high-performing and professional team. IPAS works to create new sensors that can measure the immeasurable, stimulate the creation of new industries, and improve productivity in existing industry.
The successful applicant will be responsible for the development of a new automated system for extraction and purification of the radioactive isotopes of the noble gases Ar and Kr from environmental samples geared towards complementary operation with ATTA. This is a key part of the sample supply chain which brings the ATTA to a mature project-readiness level. Typical environmental samples are sourced from groundwater, ocean water, air, and Antarctic ice. Experts at the CSIRO ETL derive the age of such samples to gain insight into the movement of groundwater or the Earth’s climatic history over hundreds of thousands of years.
The successful applicant will be trained across the entire ATTA system and be expected to also contribute to:
Developing the instrumentation for routine operation.
Developing protocols for handling of samples and storage of data and metadata.
Automation of measurement routines.
Development and maintenance of electronic equipment and vacuum systems.
Development and maintenance of optical systems.
Participate in field campaigns to collect environmental samples.
To be successful you will need:
PhD or equivalent degree (or thesis submitted) in experimental physics.
Hands on experience in experimental physics in the AMO field i.e. the measurement and manipulation of atoms using light e.g. theoretical and experimental understanding of light-atom interactions, an understanding of ensemble dynamics in warm atomic vapours, precision atomic spectroscopy.
Advanced analytical and computational skills, including data collection and analysis, and a demonstrated ability to perform numerical and symbolic calculations.
Demonstrated publication track record in leading scientific journals.
Experience with laser cooling and atom trapping desirable.

Are you interested in building great products and exporting your product to the World? If yes, we may have a position for you.
We are open to local (Adelaide) or remote (Australia / Aussie timezone) candidates.
About Us
MaxMine is a technology scale-up pushing the limits of data analytics to optimise our client’s operations. We exist to accelerate the sustainability of humanities scarce resources. We do this by recommending improvements from the collection and intelligent analysis of data, through to the application of Industrial Internet of Things technologies.
Our approach to tackling one of the world’s most pressing problems has awarded us winners of the recent Extreme Tech Challenge (XTC), at West Tech Fest in December. https://extremetechchallenge.org/
We know that net zero doesn’t happen unless mining ‘gets’ net zero. Over the next few decades humanity is going to need many more of the scarce resources that we depend on to evolve our society to net zero emissions. Whilst undertaking additional resources, it is getting harder and less economic to mine those resources. This means that there is a step change in thinking that is required throughout mining. That’s why we have developed MaxMine Carbon. MaxMine Carbon allows miners to baseline, track and improve their carbon footprint within their load and haul fleets, which makes up over 40% of their carbon footprint from sites, allowing sites to improve emissions now, not in 5 or 10 years.
We need more help to build out our product features that enable these improvements to be made. We have a great team, using cutting edge technologies and in a role with us you will have lots of scope to learn, grow and lead others.
