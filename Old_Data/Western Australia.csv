According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

Join CSIRO – Australia’s leading scientific research organisation!
CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.
Coral reefs around the world including the Great Barrier Reef are under the threat of severe coral bleaching and ocean acidification from the impacts of climate change. Conserving reefs into the future will require an understanding of the evolving distribution of climate refugia that currently protects reefs. This will depend on how reef-scale circulation and reef connectivity change with climate conditions. However, the current generation of climate models are unable to resolve critical reef-scale physical processes. The Fellow will address this critical need using machine learning approaches to rapidly downscale climate model outputs. The research will be supported by a team with expertise in ocean modelling and downscaling, machine learning, and ecological impact assessment. The Fellow will be able to exploit existing data, models and software to extend machine learning approaches for the purpose of downscaling climate models. Resulting high-resolution ocean projections will be used to estimate the future state of the Great Barrier Reef and guide conservation strategies. Combining climate knowledge with new machine learning methods will place the Fellow at the forefront of this important research area.
Your duties will include:
Carry out innovative, impactful research in climate science that will lead to novel and important scientific outcomes and publications.
Advance the application of machine learning in climate research and accurately document the methods and results.
Represent CSIRO externally in scientific forums.
Utilise design thinking methodology to plan and prepare research proposals, and apply non-academic impact methodology to research projects.

Our focus is therefore on finding someone who can bring unique talents, experience and perspective to enhance the AIV team knowledge and grow with the team as the project progresses.
The role can be based at any of the CSIRO offices in Perth, Geraldton or Sydney but may involve mutually agreed occasional domestic and international travel to the SKA-Low Construction site, other CSIRO offices and supplier locations.
In this role you will:
Translate user needs to test scripts for hardware and software interactions.
Develop software test and observation scripts for the SKA Low Telescope.
Conduct testing campaigns at the project test facilities and at the SKA-Low Telescope.
Use test experiences to contribute to the development of User Interfaces.

Liaise with diverse stakeholders at all levels and across time zones and cultures.
Contribute to the development of operational procedures.
Contribute to AIV Low activities within a Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).

We recruit and support world-class talent that represents the diversity across our society. Our focus is therefore on finding someone who can bring unique talents, experience and perspective to enhance the AIV team knowledge and grow with the team as the project progresses.
The role can be based at any of the CSIRO offices in Perth, Geraldton or Sydney but may involve mutually agreed occasional domestic and international travel to the SKA-Low Construction site, other CSIRO offices and supplier locations.
In this role you will:
Translate user needs to test scripts for hardware and software interactions.

Fruition Recruitment is a Geelong based, and Geelong exclusive, boutique recruitment firm that specialises in talent acquisition, executive search and talent advisory.

In line with this, and with an enviable internal culture, supportive management and a bright future, they now require a skilled Service Delivery Technician to join the team.

About the Culture:
This working environment is one of the best out there. Collaborative, supportive, friendly, trusting and engaging.

Your career progression will look less like climbing a ladder and more like a continuous flow of exciting, meaningful opportunities that facilitate personal development and technical mastery.

As someone who strives for open and honest communication with respect for others, you’re keen to learn about new platforms and technologies, and have a continuous improvement mindset. With sound knowledge and experience supporting Windows desktop operating systems, you’ll be skilled in building and configuring Windows based PC’s, laptops and NUC’s. Furthermore, you’ll have a solid understanding of productivity tools in Office 365 and you’ll have operating experience with Unix and be comfortable with CLI’s. Able to demonstrate a basis understanding of TCP/ IP networking, further experience with PowerShell, SQL or other scripting languages would be ideal. Skilled in communicating with a range of key stakeholders, from front line staff to C-level executives, you’ll have experience in a customer focussed, fast changing and new technology driven environment. With a high level of systems and process acumen, you have an intelligent and energetic approach to tasks, you’ll be team oriented and have a ‘can do attitude’. Proactive and forward thinking, you’ll have strong organisational and time management skills, with the ability to work independently and to multitask. With strong attention to detail, you’ll be action oriented, a self starter and able to make sound decisions. Proactive and able to get things done, you’ll also be reliable and flexible. Any experience, exposure to or skills in cybersecurity or understanding cybersecurity standards would be highly regarded, as would any experience working in service delivery under ITIL methods.

In this role, you will join a supportive and collaborative team and receive in-house training, flexible working conditions (allowing some work from home), ongoing professional development opportunities and a competitive remuneration package. With a high level of autonomy and responsibility, you’ll be problem solving real business challenges and be able to develop and grow your IT experience.

For nearly 150 years, Rio Tinto has been a company of pioneers – generations of people spanning the globe, all with the grit and vision to produce materials essential to human progress. Our iron ore has shaped skylines from Shanghai to Sydney. Our aluminium –the world’s first to be certified “responsible” –helps planes fly and makes cars lighter. Our copper helps wind turbines power cities and our boron helps feed the world and explore the universe. Our diamonds help us celebrate the best parts of life.

Do you have a PhD Ecotoxicology and/or Environmental Science?
Contribute to critical research on toxicological impacts on freshwater ecosystems
Join CSIRO – Australia’s leading scientific research organisation!
CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.
Wetlands perform critical ecosystem functions such as freshwater storage, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity habitat. However, urban wetlands are often polluted by metals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other commonly used anthropogenic contaminants. Despite a growing body of research highlighting the extent of wetland pollution, little is known about the toxicological impacts of metals and polyfluoroalkyl substances on higher-order terrestrial biota, such as frogs.
To address this research gap, we are looking for a CERC Postdoctoral Fellow with experience in vertebrate ecotoxicology, herpetofauna biology, collection and tissue sampling, toxicological data analysis and interpretation (including bioinformatics), and managing multi-disciplinary datasets. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work across multiple CSIRO laboratories, in addition to working at collaborator institutions (national and international). This will ensure you have access to state-of-the-art high throughput technologies and bioinformatics techniques in the field of systems biology and environmental omics.
Your duties will include:
Help lead the initiation, design, and execution of field-based multi-omic and whole-organism assessments of the impacts of chronic urban contaminants on frogs.
Contributing to the development of environmental pollution bioindicators, toxicity thresholds and novel organism health monitoring technologies.
Working in close collaboration with state environmental regulators and other stakeholders to maximise research impact.
Carrying out innovative, impactful research of strategic importance to CSIRO that will, where possible, lead to novel and important scientific outcomes.
Recognising and utilising opportunities for innovation and the generation of new theoretical perspectives, and progress opportunities for the further development or creation of new lines of research.

According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

Do you have a PhD in physical oceanography, climate modelling or a closely related field?
Conduct research to estimate the future state of the Great Barrier Reef and guide conservation strategies.
Join CSIRO – Australia’s leading scientific research organisation!
CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) Postdoctoral Fellowships provide opportunities to scientists and engineers who have completed their doctorate and have less than three years of relevant postdoctoral work experience. These fellowships aim to develop the next generation of future leaders of the innovation system.
Coral reefs around the world including the Great Barrier Reef are under the threat of severe coral bleaching and ocean acidification from the impacts of climate change. Conserving reefs into the future will require an understanding of the evolving distribution of climate refugia that currently protects reefs. This will depend on how reef-scale circulation and reef connectivity change with climate conditions. However, the current generation of climate models are unable to resolve critical reef-scale physical processes. The Fellow will address this critical need using machine learning approaches to rapidly downscale climate model outputs. The research will be supported by a team with expertise in ocean modelling and downscaling, machine learning, and ecological impact assessment. The Fellow will be able to exploit existing data, models and software to extend machine learning approaches for the purpose of downscaling climate models. Resulting high-resolution ocean projections will be used to estimate the future state of the Great Barrier Reef and guide conservation strategies. Combining climate knowledge with new machine learning methods will place the Fellow at the forefront of this important research area.
Your duties will include:
Carry out innovative, impactful research in climate science that will lead to novel and important scientific outcomes and publications.
Advance the application of machine learning in climate research and accurately document the methods and results.
Represent CSIRO externally in scientific forums.
Utilise design thinking methodology to plan and prepare research proposals, and apply non-academic impact methodology to research projects.
Location: Perth, WA
Salary: AU$89k - AU$98k plus up to 15.4% superannuation

For nearly 150 years, Rio Tinto has been a company of pioneers – generations of people spanning the globe, all with the grit and vision to produce materials essential to human progress.
Our iron ore has shaped skylines from Shanghai to Sydney. Our aluminium – the world’s first to be certified “responsible” – helps planes fly and makes cars lighter. Our copper helps wind turbines power cities and our boron helps feed the world, and explore the universe.

Our diamonds help us celebrate the best parts of life.
