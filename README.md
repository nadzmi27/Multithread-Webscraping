# Multithread-Webscraping
Webscrapping with Selenium by using multithread and multiprocess to speed up the scraping process. Link to my Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadzmiagthomas/australia-data-science-jobs

Note:
This is my attempt at using Selenium and multithreading. All the codes were written a few months before I uploaded this on GitHub. 
I tried running it again, and the result is a bit disappointing compared to how it was a few months ago. This could happen due to changes on the website. I'll update the code again to ensure it'll work properly.

- Old_Data contain the data scraped around August of 2022: AustraliaDataScienceJobs.csv contains all the data combined into one
