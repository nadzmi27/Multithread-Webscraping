# Multithread-Webscraping
Webscrapping with Selenium by using multithread to speed up the process. 

Note:
This is my attempt at using Selenium and multithreading. All the codes was written a few months before I upload this on github. 
I tried running it again, and the result is a bit dissapointing compared to how it was a few months ago.
